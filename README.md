## ðŸ’¡An Introduction.

Hey. I'm Aditya, and I'm a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science.

I'm an aspiring deep learning researcher working towards mastery both in the field and beyond. My mission is to leverage artificial intelligence to create tangible impact on difficult, real-world problems. Currently building better knowledge distillation methods to expand neural network reach in low-compute settings for those who need it most - accelerating ML impact on critical real-world problems in the 21st century.

Key goals:
Producing groundbreaking, field-accelerating AI research.
Changing the lives of one billion people by solving critical problems.
Crafting high-standards, excellent work in all tasks and endeavours. 
Becoming the absolute best possible version of myself possible.

Most of my work is on Google Colab rather than GitHub. Feel free to check out my website, and let me know your thoughts!
