## üí°A quick introduction...

Hey there! I'm Aditya, and I'm a 17-year-old junior in the enhanced program at the Woodlands Secondary School + The Knowledge Society alumni.

Here's a bit about me:

- üî¨**Machine learning specialist at [Actionable.co](http://actionable.co/)**, working on a recommendation engine to boost ACP impact.
- ü§ñ **Aspiring Deep Learning Researcher** - working to understand deep learning from first principles and innovate in the field (check out my work on BANs, Adam optimization, autonomous vehicles, and more)!
- üí°Learning new things! Reach out for anything DL related - looking to learn, grow, and make 10x global impact. Love hacking and anything to do with code :D

(P.S. - there's a huge gap in the contribution graph below, mainly because my Actionable and personal accounts are different üòÅ). 

(P.S. 2 - I've also made a bunch of games for school projects (some of which I'm proud of). Check them out [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/bli5PZ6ov5mz1xSAGDkBVxXKA5EU01mawbWpct7SAMg)!)
