## 💡A quick introduction...

Hey there! I'm Aditya, and I'm a 16-year-old sophomore in the enhanced program at the Woodlands Secondary School + The Knowledge Society alumni.

Here's a bit about me:

- 🔬**Machine learning specialist at [Actionable.co](http://actionable.co/)**, working on a recommendation engine to boost ACP impact.
- 🤖 **Aspiring Deep Learning Researcher** - working to understand deep learning from first principles and innovate in the field (check out my work on BANs, Adam optimization, autonomous vehicles, and more)!
- 💡Learning new things! Reach out for anything DL related - looking to learn, grow, and make 10x global impact. Love hacking and anything to do with code :D
